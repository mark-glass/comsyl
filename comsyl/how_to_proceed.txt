0. Set up configuration file. A default/example configuration file is created by "python3 AutocorrelationSimulatorConfiguration.py"
in the autocorrelation subdirectory. Start decomposition with "python3 calculateAutocorrelation.py %CONFIGURATIONFILENAME%".

1. Choose x and y grid size of undulator exit wavefront large enough to capture the entire central cone. The wavefront must be almost zero
at the boundaries of the grid. If there are strong peaks increase sampling point density.

2. Choose x and y grid size of the wavefront at the source large enough to account for zero padding in convolution.
If there are strong peaks increase sampling point density.

3. Choose x and y grid size of the wavefront at the source large enough to see the real space projection of the electron density go to zero.
If there are strong peaks increase sampling point density.

4. Look at the convoluted intensity at the source. If it has peaks/edge try increasing sampling point density and make sure the undulator
exit wavefront is calculated on a sufficiently large grid. Otherwise boundary artefacts could have been folded in to produce edges.

5. Look at the (first) modes. They should be smooth. Otherwise increase sampling point density. And they should go to zero.

7. Check that relative eigenvalue spectrum does not change drastically with further increase of sampling points. Absolute eigenvalues are
allowed to change though.

6. Propagate the mode. Does this look reasonable. Usually they just spread in realspace.
