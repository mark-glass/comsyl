# COMSYL - COherent Modes for SYnchrotron Light

COMSYL makes the coherent mode decomposition of synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons passing through an undulator placed in a storage ring. COMSYL permits naturally the statistical analysis and propagation of the cross spectral density along the beamline optics. The coherence properties of the X-ray beam at any point of the beamline are completely given in terms of the eigenvalues and coherent modes of the cross spectral density.

An example of coherent mode decomposition of undulator radiation (U18 1.4m long undulator at resonance 17225 eV)  at the ESRF-EBS calculated with COMSYL is here: https://youtu.be/h24RrJZaQ80
