#
# Note on installation of comsyl: 
#
# comsyl is not fully pip-installable, as it requires libraries for the solver
# that are hard to compile (petsc, slepc, and the python binders petsc4py and
# slepc4py)
# Fot pip-building the oasys interface, these solver-dependencies have been
# removed from the setup.py and should be built independently (see 
# installation instructions).
#
# The comsyl that is pip installable can be used with oasys to load/write
# comsyl files and therefore propagate comsyl results along the beamlines.
#
#
# To create the pip installation: 
# git checkout oasys
# python setup.py sdist
# python -m twine upload dist/*
#
